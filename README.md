Name
----

The name "cy.io" is still temporary, I haven't found a better name yet. See my [name ideas section][3] on my [braindump][4] page for ideas I came across. Please let me know your naming ideas with their reasoning.

eg. The reasoning behind "cy.io" is:

- "cy" is the Cylon in one of the [Battlestar Galactica episodes][5] which helped out the humans. A human helping robot
- "io" simply stands for input/output
